# DnD Dice Roller

This is a quick DnD dice rolling app that I made while bored. Would like to add more features in the future, and maybe a GUI.

## Directions
1. Choose your attack dice (d4, d6, etc.)
2. Put in your character's strength mod
3. Put in proficiency mod
4. Put in initiative mod

## Features
- Automatically rolls initiative
- Based on inputs (asking if you hit or not), will calculate attack rolls, damage, etc.
- Will automatically double critical hits
- Color changes for crit and crit fail text
